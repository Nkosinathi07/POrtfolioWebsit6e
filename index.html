        I am a person who loves gaming and poetry. 
        Getting into information systems was not something I knew from the jump like other individuals who are in the same field as me. 
        I never knew what i wanted to do with my life till I was sixteen years old. When finding out that I really wanted to be a
        racecar driver i dove right into the proper research into how i cqan make that a possibility. Being a person who came from a disadvantaged background i watched 
        as my new found dream evaporated with every search i made. I found that it is not easy to make it but not inmpossible, one day i will fight for that. 
        At age seventeen(17) lost when it came to what am i going to do after my matric and as a result i never applied to any higher institutions.
        During a ceremony we had after my grandfather passed a family member recommended that i go to a college while i figured out the carrer aspects of my life.
        That is i got into understand basic things about using a computer and liked it. It wasn't until I we did a psychological analysis test that revealed that one of my biggest
        interests was the world of technology and innovation. I completed my studies there and applied for higher institutions, and at 19 i was doing my first year at the University of the
        the Free State doing Bachelor of computer information systems(BCIS). My first was the stuff of movies really, it was challenge after challenge to a point where i wanted
        to drop out of school and go home. The following year i tried my best to be a competent student. 
        Finally now doing my third year i can say that i really enjoy being in this field 
        and doing and it is growing on me day by day.
